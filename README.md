# Be With Your Loved Ones
## Introduction

Be With Your Loved Ones is an animation made using Processing and P5.js: a pink-bowed pudding who wakes up from a nap and finds herself alone on the dining table, what will she do next?

## How to run

You can view the animation by cloning the repo. To watch the animation, you can either run the code in [Processing](https://processing.org/) or set up a simple local server. An example Python command for hosting a local server is shown below:

`python3 -m http.server 8080`

Note that based on your current Python version, the python3 command may need to be adjusted to fit your current version.

Once you have the server set up, simply go to the address that you have created. In this case, you would want to type `localhost:8080` in your browser. You should be able to view the full animation at this point.
